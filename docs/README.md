With this Google Calendar extension for Chrome, you'll be able to define presets of multiple calendars that can be displayed or hidden with one click. This way, you will be able to easily jump back and forth between different calendar sets.

Useful for viewing an entire team's availability, or previewing several conference rooms' load all at once.

Easily showing or hiding all calendars is also supported.

Hint: Consider combining this with the [Event Merge for Google Calendar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/event-merge-for-google-ca/idehaflielbgpaokehlhidbjlehlfcep) extension for cleaner visuals.


## Chrome Store

Add to your Chrome (or a compatible browser) at [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/multiple-calendars-select/dlfbgdklfofchbhpeimkpepfldhkpojn](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/multiple-calendars-select/dlfbgdklfofchbhpeimkpepfldhkpojn).


## Issues and Limitations

Feel free to reach out to us in case you encounter any issues.

Current known limitations are:

- Only one Google account per browser profile is supported. If you need to use several Google accounts, you can use [several Chrome profiles](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) for this.
- Very large (ca. 50+) numbers of calendars cause issues, especially on slower machines.


## Privacy Policy

When you use this extension, your presets (including the names of your calendars) are stored in your browser's local storage. They synchronise across your signed-in devices using Google Chrome's cloud-based mechanism â€” in case you have enabled it. Your presets are not shared with anyone else and no further private data is uploaded to any servers. Only anonymous usage data (such as the event of opening the extension) is collected, using Google Analytics. You can opt out of this at any time by going to the extension's options and unselecting the respective checkbox.

For the latest version of this Privacy Policy, please refer to the extension detail page on Chrome Web Store.
