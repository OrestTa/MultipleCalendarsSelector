No representations are made about the suitability of this software for any purpose. It is provided "as is" without express or implied warranty.


## Privacy Policy

When you use this extension, your presets (including the names of your calendars) are stored in your browser's local storage. They synchronise across your signed-in devices using Google Chrome's cloud-based mechanism â€” in case you have enabled it. Your presets are not shared with anyone else and no further private data is uploaded to any servers. Only anonymous usage data (such as the event of opening the extension) is collected, using Google Analytics. You can opt out of this at any time by going to the extension's options and unselecting the respective checkbox.

For the latest version of this Privacy Policy, please refer to the extension detail page on Chrome Web Store.
