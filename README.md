With this extension, you'll be able to define presets of calendars that can be displayed or hidden with one click.

Limitations:
- If you have many calendars, you will need to scroll down the list once for the extension to discover all of them.
- Two presets are supported currently.
- English and Polish are supported currently.

Your presets are stored in your browser's storage and sync across signed-in devices using Chrome.
