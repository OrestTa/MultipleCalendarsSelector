With this extension, you'll be able to define presets of calendars that can be displayed or hidden with one click.

Your presets are stored in your browser's storage and sync across signed-in devices using Chrome.

## Limitations
- If you have many calendars, you will need to scroll down the list once for the extension to discover all of them.
- Only English and Polish are supported currently.
